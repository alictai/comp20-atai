My favorite project was Assignment 4: Frogger, Part II. 
I am most proud of Assignment 3: Where In the World...

I came into this course with a decent understanding and experience using 
HTML and CSS - so very basic facets of web programming that I didn't find
particularly interesting. Through this class, though, I have grown a 
particular interest in what the web has to offer. I really liked being able to
take apart popular websites and see what they are doing - and in certain cases,
emulate them. I have definitely found an excitement for web programming after
taking this class and will be taking web engineering in the fall.
