Implementation
------------------------------
I have successfully modified my lab 7 work to use AJAX, handle exceptions, and parse
JSON data via API. I have done so through the following files:
	job.css
	job.html

Acknowledgements

I worked with Joe Canuel and Ron Hong on how to catch a 404 error we were all getting. We
also discussed how to deal with the following error: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://
messagehub.herokuapp.com/lab8.json. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-
Origin"
