  stations of the Red Line and a red polyline connecting all of the stations
- Retrieves a user's location on the map with the Google Maps default marker

  indicates the closest Red Line station, one's distance from the closest Red
  Line station. This window also displays the distance from Waldo and/or Carmen
  Sandiego if Waldo and/or Carmen are on the map.
- Displays a window, upon click of a Red Line station marker, that contains
  the name of the station and subway arrival schedule (southbound and
  northbound).

  respective icons.
